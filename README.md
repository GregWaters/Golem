# Golem is a strongly typed, modular programming language specification
It draws inspiration from the best parts of many different languages, and leverages these bits and pieces with *zero* overhead due to its compiled nature.

I am currently working on a compiler for this programming language, but it will likely take a few years if I want to do it alone.
This is mostly a proof of concept, of course, because I will have a tough time holding a torch to entire teams of people who work on compilers daily.

# Who is it for?
Golem is for programmers who want low-level control and high-level abstraction without compromise. If you write C/C++, it will most likely be incredibly simple to learn and understand.
It compiles directly to native machine code, so you don't have to deal with any bytecode or code compression like in higher level languages.
