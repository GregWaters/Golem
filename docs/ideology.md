# Check your baggage at the door
There are many important issues with today's compiled languages. Go, Rust, C++, and even C come with their own 'ideology'.
Now, this idea of a central set of ideas that brings your developers together is flawed, but is it wrong?

Using Rust as an example, there is a very strict orientation towards *safety*, and it involves a completely different approach to programming.
I would personally say that a kind of 'ideology' is justified, as you must adjust to the language in any case.
Go is a bit more extreme, having their own unified formatting tool in `gofmt`.

However, our language does not hold any groundbreaking ideas, but rather small nudges that should keep you writing code that is easy to understand and document.
I don't feel that having a set of people who are expected to think the same way about any set of things is productive.
Writing good code involves a wise mind and creativity, not repetition and regurgitation.
